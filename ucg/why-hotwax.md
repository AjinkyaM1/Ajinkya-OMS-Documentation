## HotWax Commerce solutions
The main solutions used by Frank and Oak are similar to most other NetSuite and Shopify retailers.
Streamlined Inventory Management:

HotWax Commerce provides the tools and functionalities to streamline Krewe's inventory management processes. From handling partial receipts to managing cycle counts efficiently, the system offers solutions that align with Krewe's needs. This translates to reduced manual intervention, enhanced accuracy, and improved inventory control.

Rule-Based Order Fulfillment: HotWax Commerce's brokering rules or logics enable Krewe to dictate order allocation based on specific product types, SKUs, or classifications. This feature is crucial for efficiently handling products like optical frames and prescription lenses, where legal requirements vary by location.

Integration with NetSuite: HotWax Commerce offers seamless integration with NetSuite, ensuring a smooth flow of data between systems. This integration eliminates the need for Celigo which they used to sync orders from Shopify to Netsuite.
