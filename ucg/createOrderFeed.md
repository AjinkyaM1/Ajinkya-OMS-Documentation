# Create Order Feed

Frank and Oak uses a custom create order file from HotWax that is slightly different than the out of the box used with the native NetSuite integration. Frank and Oak has their own trasnformation middleware in a platform called Boomi that has the business logic for how the order needs to be entered into NetSuite.

Here is a sample of the CSV generated by HotWax
