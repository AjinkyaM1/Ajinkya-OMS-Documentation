## Order Fulfillment
HotWax Commerce imports all orders from Shopify. During the import process, the system identifies orders containing pre-order items by verifying their memberhsip in the pre-order or backorder category. After order creation, a batch job adds relevant tags and notes in Shopify to communicate the expected ships-from date.
