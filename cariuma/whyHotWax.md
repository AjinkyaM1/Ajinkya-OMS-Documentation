# Why HotWax Commerce

## Key Omnichannel Initiatives

1. Optimize and simplify the pre-order management process, making it more efficient and scalable, especially in preparation for business expansion.
2. Have the ability to allocate quantities across multiple stores and share future inventory across different stores.
3. Manage ship dates with precision, including the flexibility to set different ship dates for the same product based on specific inventory arrival dates.
4. Efficiently handle buffer or safety stock, ensuring that overselling is prevented, and uncertainties in inventory management are managed effectively.

## Prior Initiatives

Cariuma relied on the "pre-order me" app on Shopify Plus for pre-order management, which was a time-consuming, manual process. Inputting quantities for various store locations, especially considering they had multiple Shopify stores, proved to be a cumbersome task. Managing ship dates, often with the same date but requiring precision, and incorporating buffer periods for inventory arrivals were significant pain points.

## HotWax Commerce Solutions

Cariuma decided to choose HotWax Commerce (OMS) for their pre-order management system due to several compelling reasons:

1. Ship-From Date Mechanism: HotWax Commerce offered a ship-from date mechanism that is pre-integrated with Shopify. This mechanism, which relies on metafields within product listings, is essential for Cariuma's pre-order strategy. It accurately communicates the availability of pre-order products to customers by dynamically replacing the "Add to Cart" button with a "Preorder" button, while also displaying the expected availability date.
2. Pre-order Inventory Management and Pre-Orders: HotWax Commerce ensures that pre-order items are accurately and automatically updated on Shopify. This automation is crucial for Cariuma as it eliminates the risk of overselling pre-order products, thereby maintaining customer trust and satisfaction.
3. Integration between HotWax, Shopify, and Cin7: HotWax Commerce acts as a valuable intermediary without disrupting Cariuma's existing systems. Its ability to seamlessly integrate with Shopify allows for efficient pre-order management. Furthermore, the system offers the potential to expand its role in order routing in the future.
4. Managing Promise Dates: HotWax Commerce provides an effective solution for managing promise dates, particularly for pre-orders. The ability to meet delivery promises is essential for Cariuma's reputation and customer trust.
5. Potential ATP Display: HotWax Commerce offers the intriguing possibility of displaying available-to-promise inventory alongside the ship-from date. This feature enhances the customer experience by highlighting product scarcity, which can drive demand and create a sense of urgency among customers. It aligns with Cariuma's goal of providing an engaging and customer-centric shopping experience.

Cariuma chose HotWax Commerce as their order management system because it provides a comprehensive solution that directly addresses their key business challenges related to pre-order management, inventory control, and efficient order fulfillment. HotWax Commerce's features not only enhance operational efficiency but also contribute to Cariuma's customer-focused approach and their commitment to sustainability.
