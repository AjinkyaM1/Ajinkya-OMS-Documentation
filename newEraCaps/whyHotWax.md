# Why HotWax Commerce

## Key Omnichannel Initiatives
Enable a non-channel restricted use of inventory, ensuring that stock from both their warehouse and retail locations could be seamlessly utilized for online and in-store sales.

Implement a flexible order fulfillment system that could handle three distinct purchasing patterns, including regular warehouse fulfilled eCommerce orders, online orders fulfilled by the store, and same-day buy-online-pick-up-in-store (BOPIS).
Enhance the user experience by offering pickup options within the product display page (PDP).

Allow customers to explicitly choose if they want to get an item shipped from a store if it is no longer in stock at their warehouse, and dynamically adjust shipping cost based on customer choice. 

Utilize the "Mixed Cart" feature to boost the average order value and offer a more diverse range of products to customers.

## Prior Initiatives
Inefficiency in fulfilling BOPIS orders: Orders designated for in-store pickup were being shipped from the warehouse to the store, even if the inventory was available at the store. This process was time-consuming, often taking 2-3 days, whereas customers expected same-day or faster pickups.
