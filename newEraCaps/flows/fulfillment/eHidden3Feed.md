# E Hidden 3

New Era Caps store fulfillment carrier is E-Hidden 3. This carrier does not offer a file based or API based interface for the OMS to fetch shipping labels from. Instead New Era Caps generates a CSV of packed orders from the fulfillment app which can be used to upload into E-Hidden 3 manually. To enable store staff to easily generate CSVs in the format that they need for E-Hidden 3, they leverage the custom header mapping function of the fulfillment app which lets them map the out of the box packed order feed from the fulfillment application to the format required by their carrier.

Once tracking codes are generated for orders from the carrierâ€™s portal, the store staff will reupload it into the fulfillment application. The app will then automatically save these tracking codes to the order shipments allowing them to be automatically fulfilled at the end of the day using the `Ship Packed Orders` job in the OMS.
