# Product Store

In HotWax Commerce, a Product Store represents a company or brand, useful for managing different brands. For businesses like New Era Caps Japan, with only one brand, creating just one Product Store works in HotWax Commerce.

Users have the flexibility to make further adjustments or edits as necessary to align with specific business requirements or evolving needs.
