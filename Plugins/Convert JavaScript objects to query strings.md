# Convert JavaScript objects to query strings

## qs Package

### Overview

The qs package is a JavaScript library that provides functionality for serializing JavaScript objects into query strings. By using this package, HotWax formats and handles query parameters in URLs.

### Installation

To install the qs package, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Run the following command: `npm install qs@6.10.3`

### Usage

#### 1. Importing the Package

To use the qs package in your JavaScript application, import it into your codebase. Use the following import statement:

```javascript
import qs from 'qs';
```

#### 2. Serializing Objects to Query Strings

The main purpose of the qs package is to serialize JavaScript objects into query strings. Here's an example of how to use it:

```javascript
const object = { foo: 'bar', baz: ['qux', 'quux'], corge: '' };
const queryString = qs.stringify(object);
console.log(queryString);
```

In the above example, the `qs.stringify` function is used to convert the `object` into a query string. The resulting `queryString` will be `'foo=bar&baz%5B0%5D=qux&baz%5B1%5D=quux&corge='`.

#### 3. Parsing Query Strings into Objects

The qs package also provides a method to parse query strings back into JavaScript objects. Here's an example:

```javascript
const queryString = 'foo=bar&baz%5B0%5D=qux&baz%5B1%5D=quux&corge=';
const parsedObject = qs.parse(queryString);
console.log(parsedObject);
```

In the above example, the `qs.parse` function is used to convert the `queryString` back into a JavaScript object. The resulting `parsedObject` will be `{ foo: 'bar', baz: ['qux', 'quux'], corge: '' }`.

#### 4. Additional Options

The qs package provides additional options to customize the serialization and parsing behavior. You can specify options such as array formatting, encoding, and more. Refer to the qs documentation for detailed information on available options and their usage.

### Conclusion

The qs package is a useful tool for serializing JavaScript objects into query strings and parsing query strings back into objects. By incorporating this package, you can easily format and handle query parameters in URLs within your JavaScript applications.

For advanced usage and further customization options, consult the official documentation and API reference provided by the qs package.
