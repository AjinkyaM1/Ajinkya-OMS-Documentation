## Vue Barcode Reader Package

### Overview

The Vue Barcode Reader package is a library designed for barcode scanning and recognition within Vue.js applications. By using this package, HotWax integrates barcode reading functionality into their Vue.js applications.

### Installation

To install the Vue Barcode Reader package, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
3. Run the following command: `npm install vue-barcode-reader@1.0.0`

### Usage

#### 1. Importing the Package

To use the Vue Barcode Reader package in your Vue.js application, import it into your codebase. Use the following import statement:

```javascript
import VueBarcodeReader from 'vue-barcode-reader';
```

#### 2. Registering the Component

Next, register the Vue Barcode Reader component in your Vue.js application. In your Vue component file, add the following code:

```javascript
export default {
  components: {
    VueBarcodeReader,
  },
};
```

#### 3. Using the Component

Once registered, you can use the Vue Barcode Reader component within your Vue templates. Here's an example:

```html
<template>
  <div>
    <vue-barcode-reader @onDecode="handleBarcodeScan"></vue-barcode-reader>
    <p>Scanned barcode: {{ scannedBarcode }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  data() {
    return {
      scannedBarcode: null,
    };
  },
  methods: {
    handleBarcodeScan(barcode) {
      this.scannedBarcode = barcode;
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

In the above example, the Vue Barcode Reader component is added to the template. The `@onDecode` event is used to capture the scanned barcode, and the `handleBarcodeScan` method updates the `scannedBarcode` data property.

#### 4. Customization and Configuration

The Vue Barcode Reader package provides various customization and configuration options to suit your specific requirements. You can modify the component's appearance, specify barcode types to scan, and control the scanning behavior. Consult the Vue Barcode Reader documentation for detailed information on available options and their usage.

### Conclusion

The Vue Barcode Reader package is a valuable tool for integrating barcode scanning functionality into Vue.js applications. By incorporating this package, you can enable users to scan barcodes and perform relevant actions based on the scanned data.
