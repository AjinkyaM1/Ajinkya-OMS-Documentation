# User permissions and access control

## CASL/ability Package

### Overview

The CASL/ability package is a software library designed to facilitate user permission management and access control within applications. By using this plugin, HotWax implements fine-grained authorization rule and precisely control over user permissions and actions.

### Installation

#### To install the CASL/ability package, follow these steps:

Step 1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
Step 2. Navigate to your project directory.
Step 3. Run the following command: `npm install @casl/ability`

### Steps to use

#### 1. Import the Package

To use the CASL/ability package in your application, you need to import it into your codebase. Use the following import statement:

```javascript
import { Ability } from '@casl/ability';
```

#### 2. Creat an Ability Instance

Next, create an instance of the Ability class. This instance will be responsible for managing user permissions and defining authorization rules. Here's an example of creating an Ability instance:

```javascript
const ability = new Ability();
```

#### 3. Define Authorization Rules

Once you have an Ability instance, you can define authorization rules based on your application's requirements. These rules specify what users can or cannot do within the system. Here's an example of defining authorization rules:

```javascript
ability.can('read', 'Article');
ability.can('create', 'Article');
ability.can('update', 'Article', { authorId: user.id });
ability.cannot('delete', 'Article');
```

In the above example, users can read and create articles. However, they can only update articles if they are the author. Deleting articles is not permitted.

#### 4. Check Permissions

To determine if a user has permission to perform a specific action, you can use the `can` method of the Ability instance. Here's an example:

```javascript
const canUserRead = ability.can('read', 'Article');
if (canUserRead) {
  // Allow user to read the article
} else {
  // Display an error message or handle the lack of permission
}
```

#### 5. Integrate with Application

Integrate the CASL/ability package with your application by incorporating it into your authorization logic and user interface. Use the permissions defined by the Ability instance to control access to various resources, functionalities, or UI elements based on user roles and actions.

### Conclusion

The CASL/ability package is an essential tool for managing user permissions and access control in your application. By leveraging its capabilities, you can ensure that users have the appropriate level of access to resources and functionalities, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized actions.
