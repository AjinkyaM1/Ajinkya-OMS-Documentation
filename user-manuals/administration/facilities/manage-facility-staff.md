# Manage facility Staff

To effectively oversee a facility's staff, which includes roles such as warehouse picker, warehouse packer, warehouse clerk, warehouse receiver, and warehouse manager, the store manager assigns these roles to staff members. Subsequently, staff members can access the HotWax Commerce app and perform functions specific to their assigned roles. Users can follow these steps to efficiently allocate role-specific permissions for accessing HotWax Commerce and its associated applications.
