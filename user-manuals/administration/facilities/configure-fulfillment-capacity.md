# Configure Fulfillment Capacity

Fulfillment capacity is defined based on the number of orders a facility will be able to fulfill in a day. It is set up considering various resources such as facility size, staff, and footfall. Users can set up the maximum order limit that can be allocated to that facility through the \`Online Order Fulfillment' Card. Users can manage the order capacity of the facility by following steps:

1. On the online order fulfillment card, a fulfillment capacity overflow menu on the right is presented. From the menu, retailers can define facility fulfillment capacity to take orders against it.

* **Unlimited capacity:** Removes the fulfillment capacity limit, allowing the facility to handle an unrestricted number of orders. This setting is not recommended for retail stores.
* **No capacity:** Sets the fulfillment capacity to 0, preventing any new orders from being brokered to the facility. The capacity is only set to 0 if the facility is unavailable to fulfill any upcoming orders and this should be used cautiously.
* **Custom:** Enter a custom number for the order fulfillment capacity.

2. Click on "Apply" to save the capacity. Retailers can view the consumed capacity, out of the added fulfillment capacity in the card.

The ability to configure fulfillment capacity is also available in the `Find facility page` for quick access.

Users can also see the facility order count history by clicking on the View order count history button. This will help them in setting up the capacity based on their previous record.
