# Completed Orders Tab

Completed BOPIS orders can be accessed from the `Completed` tab available on Orders page. All successfully completed orders that have been handed over to customers in past 24 hours can be viewed here along with the customerâ€™s name, order ID and list of product(s) in the order. Users can also use the `Search` bar on this page to find orders using customer name, product name, or order ID.
