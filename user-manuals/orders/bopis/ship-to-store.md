# Ship to Store

Ship to Store feature to help customers place pickup orders for products that are not\
immediately available for same-day fulfillment at their preferred location.\
Shopify Retailers can install HotWax Commerce BOPIS PDP App within Shopify enabling customers to select a specific future timeframe for their pickup. Customers will see an estimated pickup time frame displayed as "Pick up in x days" directly on the product detail page (PDP).\
\
Once the order is downloaded, HotWax Commerce categorizes it as a "Ship to Store" order and brokers it to a store or warehouse location where the inventory will be shipped to the pickup location.\
After a fulfillment location has been designated, store employees can follow the below steps to monitor and complete Ship to Store orders:\
Access Orders Tab > click on the ship to store icon at the top right corner of the page. User will be redirected to the Ship to store page.\
Using the search bar, users can search the order using customer name or order id.
