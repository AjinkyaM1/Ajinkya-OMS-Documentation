# Receiving Purchase Orders

Purchase orders are buyer-generated documents detailing product specifics, quantities, and prices. Retailers use these purchase orders to order from suppliers. Upon delivery, retailers need to verify the received inventory against the purchase order, ensuring accurate shipments and inventory counts.

When receiving inventory, retailers can also select the pre-defined location in the warehouse where the inventory will be put away. This will help in the picking process as the picker would have easy access to the item during fulfillment.
