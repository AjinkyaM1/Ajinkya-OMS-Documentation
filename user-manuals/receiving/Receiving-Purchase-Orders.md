# Receiving Purchase orders

Purchase orders are buyer-generated documents detailing product specifics, quantities, and prices. Retailers use these purchase orders to order from suppliers. Upon delivery, retailers need to verify the received inventory against the purchase order, ensuring accurate shipments and inventory counts.

The process of receiving purchase order is similar to [receiving inbound shipments](Receiving-Incoming-Shipments.md). Store associates need to navigate to the Purchase order page and search for the Purchase order ID to start the receiving process.

Store associates can also see the status of purchase orders i.e. whether they are created or approved in the Purchase order page. The Comprehensive details of all the Purchase Orders received is also available for the store associates for future reconcilations.
