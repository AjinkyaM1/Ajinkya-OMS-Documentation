# Receiving Incoming Shipments

Retailers often transfer their products from warehouses to stores for various reasons, aiming to optimize inventory management and meet customer demands efficiently. Some common reasons for this intra-company transfer include:

* Stock Replenishment
* Inventory Balancing
* Geographical Demand

## Receive Inbound Shipments


**1. Accessing the Shipments Page:**

Store associates can log in to the receiving app if they are associated with a facility. The first page users see when they log into the app is the Shipments page which houses a complete list of inbound shipments from warehouses or other stores, each accompanied by an Advanced Shipment Notice or Tracking ID. To locate specific shipments, store associates can scan the unique identifier such as ASN or Tracking ID. Store associates can also manually input the identifier in the 'Search' box to locate the shipment.

**2. Opening Shipment Details Page:**
Upon identifying the desired shipment, store associates can select it to access comprehensive details. The detailed information includes expected SKUs with product names, SKU codes, images, and expected inventory counts.


**3. Finding Specific Products within a Shipment:**
Inbound shipments can contain multiple product items, store associates can utilize the search function or scan individual product barcodes within the shipment to pinpoint specific items. The platform's enlarged image feature aids in clearer product identification for store associates.

**4. Receiving Items:**

Store associates can tap for 'Receive All' to accept the entire received inventory of an item at once, aligning it with the recorded inventory. This action increases the inventory of the product in HotWax Commerce and subsequently on e-commerce.

For larger quantities or instances where all inventory can't be counted together, store associates have the option to manually input the received quantities. This incremental process helps update the inventory count in the system. This feature is especially useful in cases of under-received inventory. Furthermore Retailers can also mandate store associates to scan the unique barcode of each SKU.

When Receiving Inventory retailers can also select the pre-defined location in the store where the inventory will be put away. This will help in the picking process as the picker would have easy access to the item during fulfillment.

**5. Saving and Finalizing:**

Store associates need to tap on the double checkmarks at the bottom of the page to conclude the receiving process and update the inventory in the system. The inbound shipments are removed from the page only when inventory for all the Products is received.
