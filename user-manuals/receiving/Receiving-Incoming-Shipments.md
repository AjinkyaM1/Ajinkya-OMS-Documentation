# Receiving Incoming Shipments

Retailers often transfer their products from warehouses to stores for various reasons, aiming to optimize inventory management and meet customer demands efficiently. Some common reasons for this intra-company transfer include:

* Stock Replenishment
* Inventory Balancing
* Geographical Demand

**How can Store Associates receive inbound shipments**

1.  **Accessing the Shipments Page:**

    \
    a. Store associates can log in to the Receiving app and access the ‘Shipment’ Page.

    \
    b. The 'Shipment' Page houses a complete list of inbound shipments from warehouses or other stores, each accompanied by an Advanced Shipment Notice or Tracking ID.

&#x20;      b. The platform's enlarged image feature aids in clearer product identification.

4.  **Receiving Items:**\


    a. Retailers can opt for 'Receive All' to accept the entire received inventory of an item at once, aligning it with the recorded inventory. This action increases the inventory of the product in HotWax Commerce and subsequently on e-commerce.

&#x20;       b. For larger quantities or instances where all inventory can't be counted together, store associates have the option to manually input the received quantities. This incremental process helps update the inventory count in the system. This feature is especially useful in cases of under-received inventory.

&#x20;     c. Retailers can also mandate store associates to scan the unique barcode of each SKU.

When Receiving Inventory, store associates can also select the pre-defined location in the store where the inventory will be put away. This will help in the picking process as the picker would have easy access to the item during fulfillment.
