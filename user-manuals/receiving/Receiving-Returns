Customers create return requests via mail or online, sending purchased items back to the warehouse or store. This returned inventory, physically shipped by the customer, must be accurately received for potential resale in e-commerce.

Store associates can lookup the incoming return shipments by navigating to the Returns page and identifying the shipments with the Return ID. Store associates can receive the returned shipment similarly to the [inbound shipments](Receiving-incoming-shipments.md).
