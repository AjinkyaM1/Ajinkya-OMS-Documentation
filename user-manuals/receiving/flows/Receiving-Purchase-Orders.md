# Receiving Purchase Orders

Purchase orders are buyer-generated documents detailing product specifics, quantities, and prices. Retailers use these purchase orders to order from suppliers. Upon delivery, retailers need to verify the received inventory against the purchase order, ensuring accurate shipments and inventory counts.

**How can Store Associates receive inventory against Purchase Orders**

1. **Accessing the Shipments Page:**

   a. Store associates can log in to the Receiving app and access the ‘Shipment’ Page.
   
   b. The 'Shipment' Page houses a complete list of inbound shipments from warehouses or other stores, each accompanied by an Advanced Shipment Notice or Tracking ID.
   
   c. To locate specific shipments, store associates can scan the ASN or tracking ID or manually input any of these IDs in the 'Search' box.

2. **Opening Shipment Details:**

   a. Upon identifying the desired shipment, store associates can select it to access comprehensive details.
   
   b. Detailed information includes expected SKUs with product names, SKU codes, images, and expected inventory counts.

3. **Finding Specific Products within a Shipment:**

   a. Inbound shipments can contain multiple product items, store associates can utilize the search function or scan individual product barcodes within the shipment to pinpoint specific items.
   
   b. The platform's enlarged image feature aids in clearer product identification.

4. **Receiving Items:**

   a. Retailers can opt for 'Receive All' to accept the entire received inventory of an item at once, aligning it with the recorded inventory. This action increases the inventory of the product in HotWax Commerce and subsequently on e-commerce.
   
   b. For larger quantities or instances where all inventory can't be counted together, store associates have the option to manually input the received quantities. This incremental process helps update the inventory count in the system. This feature is especially useful in cases of under-received inventory.
   
   c. Retailers can also mandate store associates to scan the unique barcode of each SKU. 

When Receiving Inventory, retailers can also select the pre-defined location in the store where the inventory will be put away. This will help in the picking process as the picker would have easy access to the item during fulfillment.

5. **Saving and Finalizing:**

   a. Store associates should click 'Save' to conclude the receiving process and update the inventory system.
   
   b. Notably, inbound shipments are removed from the page only when inventory for all the Products is received.
