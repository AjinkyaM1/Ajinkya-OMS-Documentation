# Returns lifecycle

HotWax Commerce, being an Order Management System, forwards the responsibility of managing returns to specialized Return Management Systems. This means that most of the process in the return lifecycle will be handled by a third-party Return Management System (RMS).

Many of our customers use Loop as their RMS to process web returns. When it comes to in-store returns, some of our customers use Shopify POS, while others opt for the Loop POS App.

When Loop processes web returns and the Loop POS App handles in-store returns, HotWax Commerce simply downloads returns for reconciliation purposes. While, when Shopify POS is used to process in-store returns, HotWax Commerce is responsible for syncing returns to ERP systems like NetSuite to ensure accurate ledger posting.

Now, let's delve into how the lifecycle of web and in-store returns is managed with these systems in play:
