# Configure Fulfillment

### Configure Online Fulfillment

Configuring the scope of participation in online fulfillment is made convenient through the Fulfillment settings card on the facility details page, allowing users to quickly set up facility-specific configurations. Users can configure the following settings for the facility:

1. **Sell Inventory Online:** `Sell inventory online` function helps users to simply choose whether they want to sell inventory online for that facility. Stores or warehouses can temporarily choose to turn online fulfillment off for several reasons such as high footfall, natural calamities, lack of resources for fulfillment, etc. Hence in such situations stores and warehouses are turned off for online fulfillment to avoid order brokering. Users also have quick access to turn online fulfillment on/off on the find facilities page.
2. **Allow Pickup:** BOPIS operations require a staging area where customers can collect their orders. However, user can decide whether they have the capacity to fulfill BOPIS orders by simply toggling on/off the `allow pickup` settings to enable or disable BOPIS for the selected facility.
3. **Use Native Fulfillment App:** `Native fulfillment app` setting enables user to specify whether the facility uses HotWax Commerce’s fulfillment app or third-party fulfillment apps. \
   For Warehouses employing a Warehouse Management System (WMS) for fulfillment, retailers can turn off the toggle, signifying that HotWax's fulfillment app will not be utilised.
4. **Generate Shipping Labels:** HotWax Commerce enables user to integrate with carrier partners so at the time of fulfillment via HotWax Commerce’s Fulfillment app, Shipping labels can be generated for this shipment process. Retailers opting not to integrate HotWax Commerce with the carrier partners and prefer to insert tracking ID in HotWax Commerce to update os Shopify can toggle off the `Generate Shipping Labels` settings.
5. **Days to Ship:** `Days to` ship are the maximum number of days the facility will take to ship the order post brokering. Enter the days to ship and click on `Update Days To Ship` button to save the configurations for the facility.

### Configure Fulfillment Capacity

Fulfillment capacity is defined based on the number of orders a facility will be able to fulfill in a day. It is set up considering various resources such as facility size, staff, and footfall. Users can set up the maximum order limit that can be allocated to that facility through the \`Online Order Fulfillment' Card. Users can manage the order capacity of the facility by following steps:

1. On the online order fulfillment card, a fulfillment capacity overflow menu on the right is presented. From the menu, retailers can define facility fulfillment capacity to take orders against it.

* **Unlimited capacity:** Removes the fulfillment capacity limit, allowing the facility to handle an unrestricted number of orders. This setting is not recommended for retail stores.
* **No capacity:** Sets the fulfillment capacity to 0, preventing any new orders from being brokered to the facility. The capacity is only set to 0 if the facility is unavailable to fulfill any upcoming orders and this should be used cautiously.
* **Custom:** Enter a custom number for the order fulfillment capacity.

2. Click on "Apply" to save the capacity. Retailers can view the consumed capacity, out of the added fulfillment capacity in the card.

The ability to configure fulfillment capacity is also available in the `Find facility page` for quick access.

Users can also see the facility order count history by clicking on the View order count history button. This will help them in setting up the capacity based on their previous record.
