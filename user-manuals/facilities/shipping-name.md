# Set Shipping Name for Facility

The shipping name feature in HotWax Commerce offers retailers flexibility and branding opportunities. Unlike the facility name, which may be more generic, the shipping name can reflect the retailer's brand name for that facility. This customization enhances brand identity and ensures a consistent customer experience during order fulfillment.

## Steps

1. **Go to the Facility App:** Navigate to the launchpad and open the Facility application.

2. **Search Your Facility:** Utilize the search function within the app to locate the specific facility for which you want to set the shipping name.

3. **Click on the Facility:** Once you've identified the desired facility, click on it to access its details and settings.

4. **Navigate to Address and Contact Details Section:** Look for the section labeled "Address and Contact Details" within the facility details page. This section contains information related to the facility's address and contact details.

5. **Enter the Desired Shipping Name:** Click on `edit` to open up a new form, add the desired shipping name.

6. **Ensure Correct Zipcode:** Alongside entering the shipping name, ensure that you input the correct Zipcode for the facility. This is crucial, as the Zipcode is required for setting the shipping name.

7. **Save Changes:** After entering the shipping name and verifying the Zipcode, save the changes to update the facility's details effectively.
