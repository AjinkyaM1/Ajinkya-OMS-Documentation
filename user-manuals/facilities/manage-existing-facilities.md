# Manage Existing facilities

After the creation of facilities, retailers need to utilise the Facility Management App to manage facility information. This includes tasks such as renaming facilities or managing external mappings in case of any updations.

### Locate Facilities

Retailers may often seek a particular facility or specific type of facilities. The locate facilities functionality will enable users to effortlessly find their desired facility by navigating to the `Homepage`> `Find Facilities` page to manage the existing facilities. There are two ways to locate the facilities for which users need to manage the configurations:

1. While looking for a specific facility, user can search the facility by name from the `search` functionality on the left.
2. To narrow down the list of facilities and locate facilities manually, user can utilise Product Store and facility Type filters.\
   For instance, if an organisation has multiple product stores and the user aims to access the facility associated with a specific product store, the dropdown menu in the product store filter will present all the product stores.\
   Similarly, if a user is seeking all the outlet stores, they can apply the type filter, select outlet store to obtain the desired facility list.

### Linking Facility with External Systems

Before configuring any settings, it's crucial to establish a connection between the facilities within HotWax Commerce and external systems like e-commerce platforms, ERP systems, and third-party logistics systems. Each facility in HotWax Commerce manages inventory, and the Available To Promise (ATP) is also controlled by retailers through ERP integration, ensuring accurate fulfillment and inventory management across the system. Users can map the HotWax Commerce facilities with external systems by following steps:

1. **Access Facility Details:** Users can click on the desired facility's name which will be redirected to the facility details page, providing a comprehensive overview of the chosen facility.
2. **External Mapping:** Scroll down to the `External Mapping` segment located at the bottom of the facility details page.
3. **Map Facility to External System:** Click on the `Add Map Facility to External System` button to initiate the mapping process.
4. **Choose External System:** In the modal that appears, choose the external system for which the user wants to create the mapping.
5. **Fill in Required details:**

* _For Shopify:_ Choose the appropriate Shopify store from the dropdown menu and add the location ID of the facilities that can be obtained from the Shopify admin panel.
* _For other Systems:_ Users can create mapping by adding the Mapping Name (External system for which mapping needs to be done) and the Mapping Value (External ID of the Facility).

7. **Save Mapping:** Once the required information is filled in, click on the `save` button to save the configuration. This integration lays the groundwork for a cohesive connection between the facility in HotWax Commerce and facility in the external system, facilitating streamlined configuration and operational processes.
8. **Edit and Remove:** Users can further edit the external ID in case of any modification of the facility on the external system or click on the `remove` button to delete the ecommerce mapping.
