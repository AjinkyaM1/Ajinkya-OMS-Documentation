# Product Inventory Configuration Page

The `Product Inventory Configurations` page in HotWax Commerce offers users the ability to configure product inventory settings globally or for individual facilities. This feature is crucial for retailers with large product catalogs, as it allows for product-specific settings that cannot be covered globally. For example, bespoke items may only be available from certain facilities, necessitating specific configurations at the product level.

## Global Settings Section:

The `Global Settings` section enables users to customize various product configurations at the company level. This customization includes managing product thresholds, order brokering, store pickup options, and shipping timelines. These settings are essential for optimizing inventory management and order fulfillment processes.

### Threshold Adjustment:

Adjusting the threshold is crucial for maintaining optimal inventory levels. During peak seasons, increasing the threshold prevents stockouts, while reducing it during slower periods prevents excess inventory.

- Click on `Threshold` to access the dialog box.
- Modify the threshold value to match your requirements.

### Order Brokering:

Order brokering optimization helps in efficient order fulfillment and inventory management. Enabling or disabling order brokering based on product-specific requirements ensures optimal order routing and shipping cost optimization. This step is essential for efficient order fulfillment and inventory management, particularly for bespoke products that cannot be fulfilled from all the locations.

- Open the dialog box by selecting `Order Brokering`.
- Toggle the setting to enable (Y) or disable (N) order brokering based on your business needs.

### Store Pickup:

Enabling or disabling store pickup options ensures accurate order fulfillment options, to the customer. This setting ensures accurate order fulfillment options, especially for products unsuitable for store pickup such as bulky items.

- Access the dialog box for `Store Pickup`.
- Toggle the setting to allow (Y) or disallow (N) store pickup according to your business model.

### Days to Ship:

Setting minimal days to ship the product is crucial for meeting customer expectations and optimizing order fulfillment timelines. For example, any bespoke items may require a minimum of 2 days to ship, therefore, they cannot be available for same-day or next-day delivery.

- Open the dialog box by selecting `Days to Ship`.
- Edit the number of days required for order shipment.

## Inventory Configuration Section:

The `Inventory Configuration` section empowers users to efficiently manage their inventory by configuring facilities, adjusting safety stock levels, and organizing locations within each facility. This feature is indispensable for businesses aiming to optimize inventory levels, streamline warehouse operations, and ensure seamless order fulfillment processes.

### Add Facility:

Adding facilities is crucial for retailers operating in multiple regions or countries to streamline storage and distribution efficiently. Not all products are available at all facilities, so facilities need to be associated with the product where the product will be sold or fulfilled from. This ensures accurate order routing and efficient inventory management across various locations.

- Click on the `Add Facility` function in the Inventory configuration section to open a dialog box.
- Select the desired facility and its location from the dropdown menu.
- Click `Add` to confirm the addition of the facility.
  
### Add Location:

Adding locations within each facility helps in optimizing product storage and organization. It enables businesses to effectively manage their warehouse space, improve inventory visibility, and streamline order picking and packing processes, resulting in enhanced operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

- Click on the `Add Location` function to open a dialog box.
- Choose the facility to which you want to add a location from the dropdown menu.
- Select the geographical information or address for the location from the dropdown menu.
- Click `Add` to confirm the addition of the new location to the selected facility.

### Editing Safety Stock:

Editing safety stock levels ensures maintaining an adequate level of stock to meet demand and prevent stockouts. Safety stock is set to ensure stores have stock that can be used in case of any inventory variance or to reserve stock for in-store sales. By adjusting safety stock levels, businesses can optimize inventory investment, minimize carrying costs, and mitigate the risk of stockouts, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and revenue generation.

- Locate and click on the edit icon of the facility for which you want to adjust the safety stock.
- Update the minimum stock (Safety Stock) as required.
- Click `Add` to confirm the changes in safety stock.
