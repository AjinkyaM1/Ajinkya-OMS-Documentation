## Filter Inventory Channel

In a multi-channel retail environment, efficient inventory management across various sales channels is crucial for success. HotWax Commerce addresses this need by allowing retailers to create distinct Sales Channel Groups for each sales channel. This feature enables retailers to allocate separate Available-to-Promise (ATP) inventories for each channel, minimizing risks and ensuring streamlined operations. By aligning inventory with specific sales channels, retailers can optimize their inventory allocation strategies and meet the unique demands of each channel effectively. The Inventory Channel Filter in HotWax Commerce provides users with the ability to focus on specific inventory channels, enhancing workflow efficiency and enabling precise inventory management.

For example, if a retailer chooses the Amazon sales channel, they will get the breakdown of the ATP that is available to sell online on Amazon.
