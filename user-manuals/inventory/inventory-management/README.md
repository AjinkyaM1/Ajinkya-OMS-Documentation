# Inventory Page

HotWax Commerce provides a unified view of inventory by seamlessly connecting with various technology systems used by retailers, including Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Point of Sale (POS), and Warehouse Management Systems (WMS). HotWax Commerce ensures that inventory updates from all these systems are synchronized to support various business scenarios. HotWax Commerce determines the "Available to Promise (ATP)" or the amount of inventory that can be sold and then sends it to ecommerce channels. This makes HotWax Commerce the ultimate authority on inventory availability.
