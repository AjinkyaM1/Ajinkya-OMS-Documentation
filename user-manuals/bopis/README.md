# BOPIS Fulfillment App

HotWax Commerce's BOPIS Fulfillment app enables retailers to efficiently manage Buy Online Pick-up In Store (BOPIS) functionality and handover store pick up orders to customers.

The app also allows retailers to seamlessly integrate their online and offline channels, offering customers the convenience of buying online and picking up their purchases in-store. This omnichannel solution streamlines the BOPIS process, enhancing customer satisfaction and driving sales.

Access to the app is secure and permission-driven. Users will only be able to view information related to stores and orders for which they have been granted explicit permissions. For example, if a store associate is assigned to the Salt Lake City facility, they will exclusively see orders and details related to that facility. Information from other facilities will not be accessible to the associate, ensuring a controlled and secure user experience.
{% endhint %}

BOPIS orders are placed from eCommerce. Customers select their preferred store on the eCom PDP. Orders are then imported into HotWax, BOPIS orders are not brokered as the facility is already selected by the customer. BOPIS Orders imported in HotWax reflect in the selected facility of the BOPIS Fulfillment app.
