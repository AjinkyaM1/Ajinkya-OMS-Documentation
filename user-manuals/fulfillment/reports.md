### Daily Warehouse Fulfillment Report

In the era of eCommerce growth, retail warehousing has become increasingly crucial to modern businesses. A fully functional warehouse gives the best output because of its low inventory carrying cost. As a result, the warehouse is responsible for fulfilling the majority of orders placed. 

As warehouse operations are incredibly massive, there is always a possibility that some brokered orders can get misplaced or left unattended during the process. For merchants, evaluating warehouse performance and order fulfillment rates becomes crucial to success.

The **Daily Warehouse Fulfillment Report** provides all the orders brokered at the warehouse but not fulfilled yet. The report shows all the daily shipped and pending orders at a warehouse. 

After identifying all the pending orders within this report, retailers can work to clear the backlog. Ultimately, this report helps to analyze the warehouse's fill rate. And in the case of multiple warehouses, it helps to compare their performance and give retailers actionable insights to improve their omnichannel order fulfillment strategy.

This performance report also yields valuable insight into the most active and least active stores within a set timeframe. With this data, retailers can work with underperforming stores to understand the reason for low activity, identify the cause of under performance, and resolve the issue.

Similarly, the retailer wants to see product-level shipping performance. The report also includes product-level performance.

### Store Dashboard
Omnichannel retailers use stores as their order fulfillment locations. Fulfillment centers help merchants meet customer expectations of faster delivery. Merchants often operate multiple stores in various locations within their operational area so they need a reliable way to measure their fulfillment performance.

Many reasons contribute to stores delaying and rejecting orders, including low operational strength and inventory shortages. Customer order cancellations are also common. Tracking store fulfillment performance enables retailers to identify and resolve these order fulfillment issues.

Likewise, merchants prefer to keep a company-wide order fulfillment goal for daily processed, shipped, rejected, and canceled orders. Any facility performing below the set goal raises a concern for merchants and puts their focus on improving performance of these facilities.  

The **Store Dashboard** shows the storewide data where the orders were brokered, rejected, canceled, and then fulfilled in a day. 

The report shows the percentage of shipped, processed, and canceled orders of the stores. Retailers can compare the actual fulfillment performance against the set goal to assess performance of each store.
