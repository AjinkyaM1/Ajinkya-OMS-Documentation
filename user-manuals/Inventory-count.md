# Inventory Count

HotWax Commerce's Inventory Count App streamlines inventory management in stores and warehouses by empowering store associates to seamlessly match physical inventory with recorded stock. This user-friendly Progressive Web Application (PWA), accessible via browsers or handheld devices, simplifies inventory counting. Store associates can efficiently scan products using mobile phones or external devices, ensuring accuracy and speed in the counting process.
Within this app, store associates have two options to reconcile inventory:

- Perform Complete Inventory Count
- Adjust Inventory Variances


## Count Complete Inventory

Store associates periodically count real-time inventory to identify any discrepancies between physical and system inventory. Here's how store associates can count the inventory of specific products with the Inventory Count App:

1. Search Product

Store associates can quickly locate products by searching products using product IDs, and SKUs from the `Search` box or utilizing the scan feature by tapping the `Scan` button to quickly scan the product barcodes. They can also view enlarged product images by tapping on the image to identify products without barcodes.

2. View Product Details

After locating the products for inventory counting, associates can tap on the item to access enlarged images and view variant details.

3. Adjust Inventory Count

Once the physical counting process concludes, store associates can manually enter the counted quantities into the `Stock` field. Retailers have the flexibility to enable a recorded inventory view for reference by activating the `Show Systematic Inventory` toggle on the settings page. Conversely, they can opt to disable this feature to ensure store associates maintain accurate records of the actual inventory.

Store associates also have the ability to access and modify the recorded location of inventory within the store or warehouse by tapping the `locations` field. This feature allows adjustments if discrepancies arise between the system's recorded location and the actual placement of inventory, ensuring precise tracking and placement accuracy.

4. Save Inventory count

Store associates need to tap on the `Save` button at the bottom of the page to conclude the counting process.

5- Upload Inventory

Following this, the inventory count undergoes review by an authorized store or warehouse manager for accuracy. Store managers can see all the variances in bulk and evaluate the variance between actual and recorded inventory levels, approving or rejecting them based on their assessment.
Store managers have access to all submitted inventory counts by navigating to the `Upload` page. Here, they can reconcile physical inventory, analyze variances against recorded inventory, and take action:

A. Managers can approve the inventory by tapping the `Upload` icon, triggering inventory updates in the Order Management System and subsequently on the e-commerce platform and ERP systems.

## Adjust inventory variance


At times, store associates may not require a complete inventory count to address inventory variances. For instance, in cases an item gets damaged, prompt adjustments are vital to prevent potential overselling on the e-commerce platform.

To address inventory variances, store associates need to locate the product and access the `Product Details` page â€”following a process similar to inventory counting.
Within the `Product Detail` page, a dedicated `Variance` tab is available for logging inventory discrepancies.

Store associates can input the desired increment or decrement of inventory from the total stock in the `Quantity` field. For instance, entering 5 adds to the inventory in case of finding any misplaced item, while -5 subtracts from the count due to damage or loss.

Associates are also prompted to select a `Variance Reason` from a dropdown menu, detailing the specific cause such as 'damaged' or 'found.'

Upon completion, tapping `Log Variance` updates the inventory count in the Order Management System and subsequently on the e-commerce platform.
