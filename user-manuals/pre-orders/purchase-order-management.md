# Purchase Order Management

Once the Purchase order has successfully been uploaded to HotWax Commerce, Merchandisers can view the purchase orders via the `Find Purchase Order` Page. This can be done by clicking on `Procurement` > `Purchase Orders` from the HotWax Commerce’s Hamburger menu.

The `Find Purchase Orders` page showcases the following details:

* Consolidated View: Offers a comprehensive display of all upcoming purchase orders and their individual items.
* Purchase Order Specifications: Presents purchase orders in an exploded pattern, revealing distinct specifications for each item.
* Purchase Order Status: Indicates the current status of the purchase order, whether it's in a created, approved, completed, or canceled state.
* On-Hand Inventory Overview: Provides insights into available quantities and available-to-promise inventory on Shopify.

Merchandisers can easily view individual Purchase orders by searching Purchase Order ID, HotWax Commerce ID, or Product name from the search bar. Moreover, they have the ability to filter search results based on PO status, arrival date, or facilities from the `search` bar.

Upon locating the desired Purchase order, merchandisers can execute various flows to ensure precise synchronization of pre-order information with the eCommerce platform.

Merchandisers can modify the purchase order arrival date if there’s a change from the supplier's end. This alteration assists in providing the accurate promise date to the customers

1. Navigate to the desired `purchase order detail` page.
2. View purchase order item details at the bottom of the page. Click the `pencil` icon to adjust the arrival date.
3. Changes made can be tracked by clicking on the `history` icon in the line item field.

## Change the Quantity of Purchase Order Items

In cases where product demand differs from expectations, merchandisers can alter the quantity of purchase order items rather than create a new purchase order. Steps to execute this adjustment include:

1. Navigate to the `Purchase Order Detail` page.
2. Click the `Edit Items` button at the top of the line items to modify quantities. Insert the accurate quantity and click on `Save` button to sync the latest inventory changes to the e-commerce platform for selling.
