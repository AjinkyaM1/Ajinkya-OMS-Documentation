# Notifications

## Introduction

BOPIS notifications provide real-time updates on new and open orders at a facility, offering enhanced convenience in managing order preparation and handover processes. Users can customize their notification preferences for the following topics:

- **New Orders:** Receive prompt notifications as new orders become available for preparation at the facility.
- **Open Orders Reminder:** Receive periodic reminders for open orders at the facility, helping users stay organized.
- **Ready for Pickup Orders Reminder:** Receive reminders for orders ready for pickup at the facility, ensuring timely customer communication.

The frequency of reminder notifications can be configured through the `Open BOPIS Order Notifications` job in the Job Manager app's Fulfillment category. Admin permissions are required for access to this feature.
