# Manage Existing facilities

Once the facilities are created, users can manage the facilities within the Facility Management App to ensure accurate online fulfillment.

### Locate Facilities

Retailers may often seek a particular facility or specific type of facilities. The locate facilities functionality will enable users to effortlessly find their desired facility by navigating to the `Homepage`> `Find Facilities` page to manage the existing facilities. There are two ways to locate the facilities for which users need to manage the configurations:

1. While looking for a specific facility, user can search the facility by name from the `search` functionality on the left.
2. To narrow down the list of facilities and locate facilities manually, retailers can utilise Product Store and facility Type filters.\
   For instance, if an organisation has multiple product stores and the retailer aims to access the facility associated with a specific product store, the dropdown menu in the product store filter will present all the product stores. \
   Similarly, if a retailer is seeking all the outlet stores, they can apply the type filter, select outlet store to obtain the desired facility list.

### Linking Facility with External Systems

Before configuring any settings, it's crucial to establish a connection between the facilities in HotWax Commerce and facilities in the external Systems such as e-commerce platforms, ERP systems, and third-party logistics systems for accurate fulfillment and inventory management.

This integration lays the groundwork for a cohesive connection between the facility in HotWax Commerce and facility in the external system, facilitating streamlined configuration and operational processes.
