# Manage Existing facilities

Once the facilities are created, users can manage the facilities within the Facility Management App to ensure accurate online fulfillment.

### Linking Facility with External Systems

Before configuring any settings, it's crucial to establish a connection between the facilities in HotWax Commerce and facilities in the external Systems such as e-commerce platforms, ERP systems, and third-party logistics systems for accurate fulfillment and inventory management. Users can map the HotWax Commerce facilities with external systems by following steps:

1. **Access Facility Details:** Users can click on the desired facility's name which will be redirected to the facility details page, providing a comprehensive overview of the chosen facility.
2. **External Mapping:** Scroll down to the `External Mapping` segment located at the bottom of the facility details page.
3. **Map Facility to External System:** Click on the `Add Map Facility to External System` button to initiate the mapping process.
4. **Choose External System:** In the modal that appears, choose the external system for which the user wants to create the mapping.
5. **Fill in Required details:**

* _For Shopify:_ Choose the appropriate Shopify store from the dropdown menu and add the location ID of the facilities that can be obtained from the Shopify admin panel.
* _For other Systems:_ Users can create mapping by adding the Mapping Name (External system for which mapping needs to be done) and the Mapping Value (External ID of the Facility).

7. **Save Mapping:** Once the required information is filled in, click on the `save` button to save the configuration. This integration lays the groundwork for a cohesive connection between the facility in HotWax Commerce and facility in the external system, facilitating streamlined configuration and operational processes.
8. **Edit and Remove:** Users can further edit the external ID in case of any modification of the facility on the external system or click on the `remove` button to delete the ecommerce mapping.
