# Manage Operating Hours

Users need to setup the operating hours of the facilities to show the information in the ecommerce PDP for BOPIS operations so that customers will know at what time they can visit the facility to collect their orders. Furthermore, adding operating hours is also essential to communicate to the shipping carriers about the store's timing.

1. Users can select the operating hours by clicking on any of the pre-existing calendars in the `Operating Hours` Card. Once the calendar is selected they can click on the `Add Operating hours` button.
2. Users can also create a custom calendar for the store by following steps:

* Click on the `Add Schedule` option to create a custom schedule.
* A pop-up menu will appear, prompting users to add a schedule name, start time, and end time. Click on the `save` icon to save standard operating hours for the entire week.
* To establish different start and end times for specific days, toggle on the `Daily Timings` option. Select the start and end time for each day of the week. If no time is specified for a particular day, it will be considered closed for that day (e.g., Saturday and Sunday).
* Click the `save` icon to confirm and save the customized operating hours.
