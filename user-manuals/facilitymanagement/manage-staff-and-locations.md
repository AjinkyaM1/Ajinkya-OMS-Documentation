# Manage Staff and locations

### Manage facility Staff

This feature allows retailers to efficiently handle facility-specific staff, assigning role-specific permissions for accessing HotWax Commerce and other HotWax Commerce applications. Users can manage facility staff by the following steps:

**Add Staff Member**

1. Navigate to the Staff section available at the bottom of the page. Click on `Add Staff Member To Facility` button to open a staff pop-up menu.
2. In the `search` tab, users can either type the staff member's name and press enter or scroll down the list of staff to find the desired member.
3. The staff member's name and ID will be displayed, accompanied by a drop-down menu on the right.
4. Select the staff role from the drop-down menu and click the `save` icon to add the staff member to the facility.

The added staff members will be listed, showcasing:

* Name and ID
* Assigned role
* Date on which the staff member was added to the facility.

To remove a staff member from the facility, click on the `cross` button located on the right side of each staff member's name within the staff details section.

### Manage Locations

Users can specify the locations with the facilities such as Aisle, Section, Level or sequence which will help store associates to define an exact place where inventory can be kept when received and where the inventory can be picked from.

**Add Locations**

To add a new location within the facility, click on the `Add Locations To Facility` button to open a location pop-up menu.

Fill in the required information to add location to the facility.

1. **Type:** The location is divided into four types.

* _Bulk_ - This area stores large quantities of inventory not intended for immediate picking or display. This is a long-term storage space for excess stock, or bulk materials.
* _Pick/Primary_ - This is where the most frequently accessed items are stored. It's designed for efficient order fulfillment, with easy access for pickers and quick movement of goods.
* _Receiving Bay_ - This is the designated area for incoming deliveries. It allows for unloading, inspection, and initial processing of new inventory before it's moved to its designated storage location.
* _Staging_ - This area acts as a temporary holding space for goods in various stages of processing. It could be used for preparing orders for shipment, kitting products, or holding returns before processing.

2. **Area:** A designated section within a warehouse or store with a specific function, department, or purpose.
3. **Aisle:** This is a designated walkway between sections within the warehouse or retail store. Aisles are numbered or named for easy navigation and identification.
4. **Section:** This further subdivides an area and usually refers to a specific range of product categories or brands.
5. **Level:** This defines the vertical plane of the location, especially in multi-story warehouses. For a single-story building, "level" might not be used.
6. **Sequence:** This term is closely related to picking and usually refers to a specific order in which items need to be picked to optimize efficiency. It could be based on product location, order size, or customer priority.

Finally, Click on the `save` icon to save the location within the facility.

**Edit Locations**

1. To edit the location of the facility, click on the overflow menu presented towards the right of each location.
2. Select the `edit location` button and edit the required updates that need to be made.
3. Click on the `save` icon to update the location.

**Remove location**

1. To remove a location from the facility, click on the overflow menu presented towards the right of each location.
2. Click on the `remove location` button to remove location from the facility.
