# Alerts and Reports

The Alerts & Reports feature in Tathya empowers users to effortlessly create event-triggered notifications (Alerts) or scheduled notifications (Reports).

## What is an Alert?

An alert provides a custom link to a chart or an entire dashboard and is triggered when a predefined event occurs. This event is a logical condition within your data, such as a failed login attempt.

## What is a Report?

A report offers a snapshot of a chart or an entire dashboard, accompanied by a link for further exploration and slicing & dicing of the query. Unlike alerts, reports run on a defined schedule (e.g., daily at 4 pm, weekly, etc.).

## Navigating to Alerts & Reports

1. In the Toolbar, hover over Settings.
2. From the drop-down menu, select Alerts & Reports.

Upon reaching the Alerts & Reports screen, the Alerts interface is displayed by default. Users can easily toggle between the Alerts and Reports tabs to control the content they wish to view.

Below the tabs, you'll find "Last Updated" information, indicating when the screen was last refreshed. Users can force a refresh by selecting the circular "Refresh" icon.

## Filters and Search Features

- **Created By:**
  - Select a user to display alerts or reports created by that individual.

- **Status:**
  - Choose an option to display entries based on the selected status, such as Default, Success, Working, Error, Not Triggered, or On Grace.

- **Search:**
  - Utilize the Search feature by entering a term in the text-entry field or selecting the magnifying glass icon. The table will then display entries matching the search criteria.

## Table Column Headers

The Alerts and Reports tables feature the following column headers:

- **Last Run:**
  - Displays the date, time, and UTC hour difference when the entry last ran.

- **Name:**
  - Represents the name of the alert or report, defined during addition or editing.

- **Schedule:**
  - Indicates the defined schedule of the alert or report (e.g., every hour, every minute, etc.).

- **Notification Method:**
  - Displays an icon indicating that notifications will be sent via email.

- **Owners:**
  - Icons indicating the owner(s) of the alert or report.

- **Active:**
  - A toggle switch indicating whether the alert or report is currently enabled or not.

- **Actions (visible on cursor hover):**
  - Icons enabling access to the execution log, editing the entry, or deleting the entry. Detailed descriptions of each action are provided below the table.

By leveraging these features, users can efficiently manage and monitor their alerts and reports, ensuring timely and relevant notifications based on predefined conditions or schedules.
