# User Creation

With roles set up to manage access to dashboards and charts, the next step is to create user profiles and assign the appropriate roles.

**Note:** Skip this step if the user is already listed on Tathya.

## Prerequisites

User access to Tathya requires prior registration on LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol).

**Note:** LDAP serves as a centralized user management platform which ensures authentication across various systems. The LDAP integration allows for a single sign-on (SSO) experience, where a registered user can use their LDAP credentials to access multiple systems, including Nifi and Tathya.
