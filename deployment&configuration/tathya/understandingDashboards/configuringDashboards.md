# Save Chart to an Existing Dashboard Or Create a New Dashboard

While in the process of saving a chart, you have the option to directly add it to a dashboard.

In the "Add to Dashboard" field, you can specify whether you want to add the chart to an existing dashboard or create a new one.

If you would like to save the chart to an existing dashboard, then select the dashboard from the drop-down list.

If your  new chart does not align with the existing dashboards go ahead and enter the dashboard name and create a new dashboard.

Select Save or, to browse directly to the defined dashboard, select Save & Go To Dashboard.

The added chart becomes easily shareable. Options include downloading data or a PNG file, copying the chart link, or setting up regular email reports for automated sharing.

Locate and click on the "Dashboards" option in the top navigation menu. This will take you to the dashboard management page.

Click on the "+ Dashboard" button to initiate the creation of a new dashboard.

Provide a meaningful and descriptive name for your dashboard. Add any relevant tags or categories.

A list of existing charts will be displayed. Choose the charts you want to include in your dashboard. These could be charts, graphs, or any visualizations you've previously created.

Use the drag-and-drop functionality to arrange the selected charts on your dashboard. This allows you to create a customized layout that visually communicates your insights effectively.

Fine-tune the layout by adjusting the size and position of each slice using the drag-and-drop feature. Customize the dashboard title, description, and other settings. Consider adding annotations for clarity.
