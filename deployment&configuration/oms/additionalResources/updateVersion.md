# Updating Order Management System (OMS)

Updating OMS is vital for security, performance, and efficiency. The latest versions often include essential security enhancements, safeguarding your business and customer data. Performance improvements lead to smoother operations, faster order processing, and enhanced user experience. Regular updates also address bugs, preventing disruptions in your order management process. In essence, OMS updates are a simple yet crucial step in maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of your business processes.

## How to update OMS to the latest release version?

Please check the current release version of your Order Management System (OMS) before you initiate any updates. This practice helps anticipate potential challenges, especially when transitioning from a significantly older version to a new one. Such updates may require manual data input and adherence to specific SQL processes. Failing to follow the correct procedures during the OMS update could lead to version management conflicts. 

To check your OMS current release version, follow these steps:

1. Go to your OMS instance: https://{instanceName}.hotwax.io
2. Open the Hamburger menu and scroll to the bottom of the page.
3. Click on the 'Powered by HotWax Commerce' icon to access the Dashboard.
4. In the Dashboard, you'll find a table displaying the current release versions for `oms` and `omssetup`:

| Name       | Branch                |
|------------|-----------------------|
| `oms`        | currentReleaseVersion |
| `omssetup`   | currentReleaseVersion |

The `oms` version reflects your current OMS version. Compare it with the version you intend to deploy for accurate version management. This step ensures a seamless and informed update process.
