# Order Tracking Notification

The `Fulfillment Notifications` feature in HotWax Commerce streamlines the order fulfillment process by updating tracking information on Shopify. By utilizing the `Fulfillment Notifications` settings, retailers can ensure that their customers receive timely and accurate updates on the progress of their orders through Shopify's established notification system.

## Step-by-Step Usage Instructions:

1. Login to HotWax Commerce using your credentials.
2. Access the settings by clicking on the Hamburger menu, then select `Settings` and navigate to `Stores`.
3. Identify and click on the `store` for which you want to configure Fulfillment Notifications. This directs you to the `View Store` page.
4. Locate the store settings section on the View Store page and click the `Add"`button to add a new configuration.
5. After clicking `Add,` a pop-up window will appear, prompting you to enter configuration details.
6. In the Type dropdown, select `Fulfillment Notifications` to specify the type of configuration you are setting up.
7. Enter `Y` in the `Value` field, as it is a mandatory field for configuring Fulfillment Notifications.

Once the settings are saved, HotWax Commerce will update the tracking information on Shopify. The system appends the tracking code to the shipping carrier's base URL, ensuring accurate and timely updates for customers.

With the tracking information updated on Shopify, the platform automatically triggers notifications to customers, keeping them informed about the fulfillment status of their orders.
