## Add a Company Name
This is the organization at the top of the retailers heirarchy. If a retailer has multiple brands, this would be the name of the organization that owns all of them.

To configure the company name, you'll have to navigate to Webtools.

```
{hostname}.hotwax.io/webtools
```

Under "Framework Web Tools", click "Entity Engine". Search for the "WebSite" entity.
```
WebSite
```

Open the website entity and click search to see a result of the all the companies configured in the system. By default there should only be one company which is part of the default setup.

Continue to the detail page of the defualt company by clicking 'View'.

In the Company Detail page, click "Edit" and change the name of the company in the field "siteName".

If a brand only has one Product Store, its a good idea to reuse its name here.
