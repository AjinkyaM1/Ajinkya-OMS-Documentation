# Setup Facilities

To create facilites in bulk during initial setup, its recommended to use the facilities CSV.

## Get a sample facility CSV

Go to the "Facilities" page under "Warehouse" in the sidebar. Here you can download a sample CSV by clicking "Export" with a default facilities data included in it for reference.

Here are what each of the required columns mean:

- **Facility ID:** Give a facility ID which can be alphanumeric. It is recommended to keep the facility ID same as Shopify store name.
- **External facility ID:** Give the same value as the facility ID.
- **Facility name:** Use the same name as in Shopify.
- **Facility type ID:** There are two types of facility IDs, RETAIL_STORE for stores and WH for warehousees.
- **Address:** Give the complete address of the facility if given by the client or available in Shopify.
- **Facility group:** Decides if inventory for the facility will be included for online sales.
- **Product Store:** If there is only one product store, by default the product store value will be ‘STORE’.
