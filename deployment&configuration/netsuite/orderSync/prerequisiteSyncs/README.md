# Prerequisite setup

Before order sync can be setup, there are a set of data points that need to be configured to ensure an automated sync.

- [ ] SFTP Locations
- [ ] Shipping methods
- [ ] Promo Codes
- [ ] NetSuite Facility Group

While most steps are not dependent on one another, SFTP locations must be setup first before syncing Promo Codes from NetSuite.
