# Setup a Shopify Configuration

New Shopify stores can be connected by going to "Create Shopify Shop" from the sidebar.

Fill out your Shopify details:

**Shop ID:** The internal name of your Shopify Store. The default value is “SHOP” but if you need to setup multiple stores, change it to a unique value. This is often needed for retailers with multiple brands. For example you are setting Shopify stores for Canada and US, it should be US_SHOP and CA_SHOP. 

**Shopify Config ID:** ShopifyConfigId should be “SHOP_CONFIG” if you're only connecting one store. Add a unique value when connecting multiple stores.


**Shopify Config Name:** ShopifyConfigName varies projectwise. Use the instance name along with Shopify Config. Ex. WSC Shopify Config

**Shop:** Shop value will be the shop name from the shopify URL. For example if the URL is hc-demo.myshopify.com, the shop name will be hc-demo

**Access Token and Shared Secret:**  Access Token and shared Secret will be shared by the retailer or can be fetched during custom app setup.

**Product Store:** Product Store to connect Shopify store to.

**WebSite:** If you changed your website name to your Product Store name, use the same name here.
