# Why HotWax Commerce

**Case 1: Product-Specific Routing for Engraved Items**

* **Problem:** Gorjana offers a unique selection of bespoke (custom-made) products that require engraving before shipment. However, current routing rules prioritize stores with non-engraved inventory, leading to fulfillment issues where orders are routed to stores instead of warehouses.
* **Solution:** HotWax OMS enables product-based routing. Orders containing bespoke, engravable items are automatically directed to warehouses for engraving, ensuring proper fulfillment.

**Case 2: Configuring BOPIS and Ship-from-Store**

* **Problem:** Gorjana desires BOPIS (Buy Online, Pickup In-Store) functionality at all stores, but only select stores should offer ship-from-store capabilities.
* **Solution:** HotWax OMS allows configuration of locations (stores and warehouses) for specific fulfillment options (BOPIS, ship-from-store, both, or none).

**Case 3: Accurate Inventory Allocation**

* **Problem:** Shopify allocates inventory incorrectly during order placement, leading to discrepancies with actual warehouse inventory. This can result in overselling or underselling of products.
* **Solution:** HotWax OMS eliminates the need to rely on Shopify's allocation system. By taking control of inventory management, HotWax ensures accurate inventory allocation and prevents order fulfillment issues.

**Case 4: Prioritized Store Fulfillment**

* **Problem:** Gorjana desires to fulfill orders from stores only after warehouse inventory depletion, with priority given to specific stores for maximizing efficiency.
* **Solution:** HotWax OMS allows creation of store groups for prioritization during inventory allocation. When warehouse stock is depleted for a particular item, orders are routed to stores based on designated group priority. This ensures optimal fulfillment efficiency.

**Case 5: Streamlined In-Store Inventory Management**

* **Problem:** Transfer orders (warehouse-to-store or store-to-store) require staff to log into multiple systems (HotWax and RF Smart) for receiving, creating inefficiency.
* **Solution:** HotWax synchronizes transfer orders directly from NetSuite. Depending on the order status, these transfers appear in the HotWax receiving app, eliminating the need for staff to switch between systems and streamlining the receiving process.

**Case 6: Optimized Inventory Sync with Shopify**

* **Problem:** Current integration with Celigo leads to API throttling on Shopify, preventing real-time inventory updates. This can cause discrepancies between Shopify's inventory levels and actual stock.
* **Solution:** HotWax's inventory sync is optimized for Shopify's API limits, enabling frequent (even hourly) updates to ensure inventory accuracy in Shopify. This is especially beneficial when using HotWax's in-store inventory management tools for tasks like receiving and cycle counting.

**Case 7: Multiple Exchanges and Return Tracking**

* **Problem:** Celigo doesn't support Shopify's multiple exchange/return functionality, hindering lifetime warranty exchange tracking for Gorjana's products.
* **Solution:** HotWax synchronizes all exchanges within Shopify and links them to the original sale in HotWax. Exchanges are then pushed to NetSuite as new sales orders with proper credit applied. Subsequent exchanges utilize credit memos from previous exchanges, ensuring seamless tracking of exchanges throughout a product's lifetime.

**Case 8: Blind Returns and Exchanges for Damaged Products**

* **Problem:** Finding original orders for damaged product returns creates long wait times and a negative customer experience in stores.
* **Solution:** HotWax OMS provides a workflow for blind returns and exchanges. Store staff can process returns for damaged items without needing to locate the original order, expediting the customer service process. Gorjana can still record reasons for returns/exchanges for product development insights. Additionally, recording returns at store locations allows tracking of damaged inventory and efficient transfer back to the central DC for further processing.
