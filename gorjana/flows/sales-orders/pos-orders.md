# POS Orders

POS sales, orders where the customer pays for the items in store and doesn't require fulfillment, are currently posted to NetSuite with a unique "Digital" shipping method. All orders with this specific shipping method are auto fulfilled by a script in NetSuite.

HotWax has a special feed for POS Sale orders which will be customized to feed into the Sales Order import rather than Cash Sales and all items on orders will always include this shipping method.

## Longterm roadmap

Long term Gorjana will investigate internally what the impact of transitioning to the NetSuite Cash Sale function would entail. This method is far more industry standard and would reduce a customization from the implementation.
