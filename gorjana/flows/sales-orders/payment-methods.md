# Payment Methods


This page contains the payment method mappings for Shopify <> HotWax <> NetSuite

In case a payment method in Shopify and HotWax is not mapped to a payment method in NetSuite, the integration layer will fall back to a `DEFAULT` payment method. As of April, this fallback payment method is mapped to “Shopify Payment” in NetSuite.
