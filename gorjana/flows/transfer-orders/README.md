# Transfer orders

## Receive in HotWax
Transfer order names will be shown in the receiving app and highlight the native field details from NetSuite like transfer order name.

Because Gorjana uses ShipHawk, it's possible that the custom table "ShipHawk Package Items" will need to be used when importing fulfilled TOs into HotWax for receiving.

## Fulfill in HotWax
Transfer orders that are fulfilled from HotWax will be posted as multiple fulfillments in NetSuite when fulfilled in multiple shipments.
