# Why HotWax Commerce

## Key omnichannel initiatives
Seamlessly integrate their online and physical stores, allowing customers to access inventory without channel restrictions.

Implement a flexible order fulfillment system that could handle two distinct purchasing patterns, same-day buy-online-pick-up-in-store (BOPIS) and Ship from Store that includes two shipping methods, Same Day Delivery (SDD) and Next Day Delivery (NDD).
Enhance the user experience by offering pickup options within the product display page (PDP).

Utilize the "Mixed Cart" feature to boost the average order value and offer a more diverse range of products to customers.

## Prior Initiatives
BOPIS Integration: Perry Ellis was using Shopify, but they faced challenges in marking orders as ready for customer pickup. The absence of REST API calls for this purpose created complexities and limitations in their BOPIS workflow. Their desired approach was to facilitate customers' easy and secure order pickups at their convenience.

## HotWax Commerce Solutions
To accomplish these objectives, Perry Ellis selected HotWax Commerce as their Order Management System (OMS) of choice:

**BOPIS:** HotWax Commerce introduced BOPIS that enabled Perry Ellis to enhance their omnichannel capabilities. With a "Buy Online, Pick Up in Store" application, Perry Ellis offered customers the convenience of selecting their preferred store, establishing it as their "My store." The default store setting remained even as customers browsed other products on the website, simplifying the order pickup process.

**Same Day Delivery (SDD) and Next Day Delivery (NDD):** The SDD and NDD from Store feature allowed customers to identify products available for same-day shipping, based on specific criteria. The solution ensured that orders were dispatched within the required timeframe, optimizing the Same Day Ship from Store process.

**Efficient Order Handling:** All orders from Shopify were efficiently managed through the Ecom Hub. HotWax Commerce imported these orders and processed BOPIS and Same Day Ship from Store orders, ensuring a seamless customer experience. Notifications for order readiness and delivery were efficiently coordinated with external systems, such as Listrack for customer notifications and Shipt for order pickups and deliveries.

HotWax Commerce also integrated with these systems through APIs, facilitating efficient marking of orders, customer communication, and order management. The collaborative efforts of HotWax Commerce and Perry Ellis provided a streamlined omnichannel shopping experience, meeting the retailer's key objectives.
