# Why HotWax Commerce

## Key omnichannel initiatives
Seamlessly integrate their online and physical stores, allowing customers to access inventory without channel restrictions.

Implement a flexible order fulfillment system that could handle two distinct purchasing patterns, same-day buy-online-pick-up-in-store (BOPIS) and Ship from Store that includes two shipping methods, Same Day Delivery (SDD) and Next Day Delivery (NDD).
Enhance the user experience by offering pickup options within the product display page (PDP).

Utilize the "Mixed Cart" feature to boost the average order value and offer a more diverse range of products to customers.

## Prior Initiatives
BOPIS Integration: Perry Ellis was using Shopify, but they faced challenges in marking orders as ready for customer pickup. The absence of REST API calls for this purpose created complexities and limitations in their BOPIS workflow. Their desired approach was to facilitate customers' easy and secure order pickups at their convenience.
