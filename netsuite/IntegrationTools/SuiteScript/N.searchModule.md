# N/Search Module: Dynamic Data Retrieval

The [N/Search module][searchModule] plays a pivotal role in our integration strategy, significantly enhancing our data retrieval capabilities. This module empowers developers to query data from the NetSuite database, offering the flexibility to create new searches programmatically, with filters and conditions. When conducting dynamic searches, the N/Search module generates a new dynamic SavedSearchId, which can be reused in subsequent processes.

Furthermore, developers can also harness existing SavedSearchIds created through NetSuite's user interface.
