# Order Sync
Reports that will help ensure that orders are syncing across Shopify, HotWax and NetSuite.

## Missing Order Attribute Report
The order sync with NetSuite and approval for fulfillment is tracked by the correct corresponding order attributes being added to orders in a systematic way. The Missing Order Attribute report helps track orders that are missing the order attributes that confirm order sync with NetSuite. This report helps ensure that no orders fail to sync with NetSuite.

## POS Cash Sale Exp Failed Report
POS cash sales are exported to NetSuite through a dedicated sync process and the POS cash sale exported failed report tracks POS cash sales that failed to sync to NetSuite.

## HotWax Order Count Report
The daily order count report shows a count of the new orders that entered the OMS. This number can be used to compare against the daily order count in Shopify to ensure that all new orders have been synced into the OMS

## Duplicate UPCA Report
Product sync from Shopify can cause discrepancies when a product in Shopify is deleted and recreated. To help monitor these discrepancies and make sure they are corrected to ensure smooth order fulfillment.

## Canceled Order Report
A report of all the orders that entered the OMS that are now canceled. Cancelations are not synced to NetSuite automatically by HotWax, this report can be used to ensure that all cancelations have been made in NetSuite as expected by Celigo or by NetSuite users.
