# Order cancellations

When a user cancels an order on Shopify, the cancellation information is synced to HotWax Commerce and NetSuite separately. HotWax Commerce has a prebuilt integration with Shopify, for downloading and syncing canceled orders and canceled order items from Shopify. For NetSuite, the order cancellations from Shopify are synced using the pre-existing integration with Celigo. The integrations ensure that the user does not need to manually sync data between NetSuite and HotWax Commerce for order and order item cancellations. The process is automated and seamlessly managed by the respective integrations. The orchestrated flow guarantees data consistency across Shopify, HotWax Commerce, and NetSuite, providing Krewe with an efficient and reliable order cancellation workflow.

**In summary**, the prebuilt integrations with Shopify and Celigo middleware ensure a hassle-free and automated workflow, eliminating manual intervention in syncing orders and order item cancellations between NetSuite and HotWax Commerce.
