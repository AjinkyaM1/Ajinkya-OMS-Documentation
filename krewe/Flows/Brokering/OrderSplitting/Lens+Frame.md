# Lens and Frames

Custom lenses that are added to cart by customers in Shopify for frames will be shipped with those frames in the same shipment. To support the special linking between the frames and lenses added to cart by the customer, a special line item property will be added to the lenses when added to cart that will identify which SKU in the cart they are linked to.

When imported into HotWax Commerce, these line item properties will be used to associate these order items as a Kit that needs to be fulfilled together. From there on, the items will be allocated together; if a frame is on pre-order, its lens will be held from fulfillment until the frame can be allocated.
