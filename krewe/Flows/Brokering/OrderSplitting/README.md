# Order Splitting

Krewe would like to add support for two types of products which require special handling during order fulfillment. The first type of products are accessories, which are linked to a parent product and are always allocated and shipped with their parent product in an order. The second type is gift products, which the customer is not charged for and therefore should not be shipped alone. Gift products are not linked to any other order item in particular but cannot be shipped without a standard order item.

Both of these products can also be purchased by customers independently, in which case they are to be treated as normal products without any special form of automated logic.
