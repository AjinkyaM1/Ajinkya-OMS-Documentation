# Product Store

In HotWax Commerce, a Product Store represents a company or brand, useful for managing different brands. For businesses like Krewe, with only one brand, creating just one Product Store works in HotWax Commerce.

This page displays the default settings configured for Krewe, specifically adjusted to match its unique business needs. These settings are pre-configured to streamline operations and reflect the typical setup ideal for Krewe's operations within HotWax Commerce.

Users have the flexibility to make further adjustments or edits as necessary to align with specific business requirements or evolving needs.

Certain settings are essential for every Product Store to ensure efficient operations.
