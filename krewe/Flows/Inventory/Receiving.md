# Receiving

During receiving, there may be items that are over, or under received. To help handle these discrpencies, the Krewe team has to make manual adjustments in NetSuite. To help their team know which Transfer Orders or Purchase Orders need to be adjusted, HotWax will schedule a report that will identify the problematic items and the discrepency.

### Receiving Discrepancy
Track discrepancies at facilities where the actual receipt was not in line with the expected shipped amount from NetSuite for fulfilled transfer orders. Facilities that are reporting higher discrepancies will be at the top to help narrow down issues with inventory levels.
