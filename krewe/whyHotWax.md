# Why HotWax Commerce

## Key Omnichannel Initiatives

Enable a non-channel restricted use of inventory, ensuring that stock from both their warehouse and retail locations could be seamlessly utilized for online and in-store sales.

Implement a fulfillment system that could handle three distinct purchasing patterns, including same-day buy-online-pick-up-in-store (BOPIS), regular warehouse-fulfilled eCommerce orders and online orders fulfilled by the store.

Implement flexible order fulfillment rules based on specific product classes, such as those for prescription (Rx) lenses, which may differ by location to ensure that orders are fulfilled in compliance with applicable state laws. It's imperative to fulfill orders exclusively through retail stores that have an on-site doctor available as mandated by the law.

Improve the efficiency of brick-and-mortar stores through user-friendly tools. This includes streamlining processes like cycle counting and transfer orders fulfillment and receipt.
