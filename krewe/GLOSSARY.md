# Glossary

## Frame product

Krewe sells "configurable" products where customers can choose the frame and lense they want independently. This is most common for prescription orders where the customer is getting a custom pair glasses. The frame product specifically refers to the frame which will be paired with a lens.

## Rx product

Rx is a short form for prescription products. These products include optometrist measurements for lenses. When orders for these products are placed, customers are also sent a separate link where they upload their prescription details which Krewe sends to lens cutting labs when fulfilling orders for these products.

## Nashville brokering

Nashville brokering refers specifically to the brokering of unfulfilled prescription orders placed in the Nashville retail location.

## Head office

Head office is a term often used by Krewe to refer to their primary operations team as well as the primary inventory DC warehouse location.

## 1020 Thalia

Also referred to as the "Thalia" location, this is another term used to refer to Krewe's warehouse. The name is derived from the name of the street the warehouse is located on.

## Case product

Almost all of Krewe's sunglasses come with a case to store the glasses. Their inventory is independently tracked and so case products are actually added to orders after order creation in NetSuite. Their fulfillment is not synced back to HotWax, but there are plans to introduce case automations into HotWax and turn it off in NetSuite to allow for partial allocation.

## Gift with purchase

Refers to items automatically added to orders in Shopify as a gift with the items the customer actually purchased. Some examples include totes, bags or lense cleaning cloths.
