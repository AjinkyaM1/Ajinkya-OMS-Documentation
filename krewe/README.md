# Introduction

## Krewe's Business Model

Krewe is a eyewear retailer that operates a total of 16 stores, including mobile units that relocate every six to eight months. Their product procurement spans a variety of optical frames and prescription lenses. These are sold through multiple sales channels, including brick-and-mortar stores and e-commerce.

## Their Retail Domain

Krewe specializes in eyewear, showcasing a range of optical frames and prescription lenses. They also accommodate different state laws regarding eyewear sales. They are also interested in implementing features such as ship-from-store and buy-online-pick-up-in-store (BOPIS), with a specific focus on their physical store locations. Krewe seeks a seamless integration with NetSuite, emphasizing the importance of it being API-based without the need for third-party involvement (Celigo). The client is keen on ensuring a smooth data flow between their Shopify platform and NetSuite, particularly concerning product information, order processing, and inventory management.
