# Update Fulfillment App

## Introduction

HotWax Commerce has enhanced its `Fulfillment` app with major UI improvements and new case-handling features. These updates address the challenges of managing kit products and streamline the order rejection process, making it easier for retailers and store associates to handle orders efficiently and accurately.

## Kit Products Visibility

The new user interface improves the handling of orders with kit products. The enhanced app provides clear identification and management of kit products within the order view.

### Identifying Kit Products:

* **Kit Labels:** Kit items now display a `Kit Label` next to their identifiers in the order view. This visual cue helps store associates quickly recognize items that are part of a kit.
* **Options Icon:** Click the `Options Icon` next to the kit label to view all items included in the kit. This feature is particularly useful for store associates when a customer orders multiple kit products in one order, enabling them to identify which items belong to each kit easily.

### Managing Kit Products:

* **Stock Visibility:** Stock visibility for the entire kit is based on the item with the least inventory. This ensures that store associates have an accurate view of the availability of kit items.
* **Order Rejection:** Use the `Bin` icon to reject kit items. The selected rejection reason will be applied to all items in the kit, ensuring consistent handling of kit products.

## Order Rejection Options

Previously, store associates had to manually select rejection reasons for each order item, leading to unnecessary order splits. The updated Fulfillment App streamlines the process by allowing Retailers to choose between partial and full shipment rejection from stores. If an order has two items, they can decide to split the order by partially rejecting items for faster fulfillment. Alternatively, they can reroute the entire order to a different facility for cost-effective shipping.

### Enable Partial Rejections Toggle:

* **Settings Page:** Navigate to the `Settings` page and locate the `Partial Rejections Toggle`. Enable or disable partial rejections based on your preferences.
* **Save Changes:** Click the `Save` button to apply the changes and ensure the new settings are active.

### Reject Partial Orders

* **Partial Rejections:** Store associates can reject individual items by clicking the `Bin` icon and selecting the appropriate rejection reason. The reason will apply only to the selected item.
* **Complete Rejections:** If partial rejections are disabled, store associates can still reject individual items using the `Bin` icon, but all other order items will also be marked as `Reject Entire Orders`. The items with `Reject Entire Orders` won't have any impact on their inventory.
