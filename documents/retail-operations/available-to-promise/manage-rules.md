# Manage Rules

Retailers can manage the scheduling of the job responsible for ATP (Available to Promise) rules from the top of the page. By default, ATP rule jobs are scheduled to run at midnight to ensure ATP calculations occur when store traffic is minimal, making the inventory ATP ready before the start of the day.

Retailers can view the history of job runs, disable a job, or run a job once by selecting the relevant option from the job's overflow menu.

Each rule card provides an overview of configurations and product facility selections. Retailers can click the "Edit rule" button to modify rule configurations.

The rule configuration can be adjusted by toggling the store pickup and shipping options on or off, or by setting values for threshold and safety stock by clicking on the number chips.

A balloon icon in the bottom right corner allows retailers to collapse or expand the inventory rules. Retailers can collapse the inventory rules to rearrange the sequencing of the inventory rules according to the cascade.
