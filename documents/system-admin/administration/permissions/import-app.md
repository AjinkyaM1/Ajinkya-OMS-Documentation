# Import App

The HotWax Commerce Import App is designed specifically for merchandisers to manage purchase order inventory and regular inventory imports from external systems into HotWax Commerce using CSV files. Since inventory management at the enterprise level is a critical function, access to the Import App is restricted to users responsible for these tasks. Therefore, only users with "IMPORT_APP_VIEW" permissions can access the app. Additional permissions are required to manage specific processes within the Import App, ensuring that only authorized personnel can execute sensitive tasks.

Below is a list of all the actions available in the Import App, along with the specific permissions needed to perform them.

Hereâ€™s a detailed table of the actions available in the Import App, organized by the Inventory Page, along with the specific permissions needed to perform them:
