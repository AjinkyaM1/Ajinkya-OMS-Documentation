# BOPIS app

The HotWax Commerce BOPIS App is designed for store staff to efficiently ma-ge the fulfillment of Buy Online, Pick Up In Store (BOPIS) orders. Similar to the Fulfillment App, store users can carry out essential tasks such as picking, packing, and handing over orders without needing special permissions. As a result, access to the BOPIS app is open to all users involved in the order fulfillment process. However, ma-ging the app's configurations, such as altering settings or workflows, requires higher-level permissions.

Below is a list of all the actions available in the BOPIS App, along with the specific permissions needed to perform them.

Hereâ€™s a detailed table of the actions available in the BOPIS App, organized by page, along with the specific permissions needed to perform them:
