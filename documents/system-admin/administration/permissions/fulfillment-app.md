# Fulfillment App

The HotWax Commerce Fulfillment App is designed specifically for store fulfillment teams. It allows store users to carry out basic tasks such as picking and packing without needing special permissions. However, sensitive actions like marking an item as shipped or altering fulfillment-related settings require higher-level permissions. Below is a list of all the actions available in the Fulfillment App, along with the specific permissions needed to perform them.

| Action                                            | Permission                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
