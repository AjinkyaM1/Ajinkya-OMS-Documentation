# Facilities App

The HotWax Commerce `Facilities` app is designed for specialized users such as admins and store heads. It facilitates the creation of new facilities within HotWax Commerce, mapping them with external systems, and managing their scope of participation in store fulfillment processes. Consequently, access to the Facilities App is restricted to specialized users only. To log in to the Facilities App, users must have the "FACILITIES\_APP\_VIEW" permission.

All actions within the `Facilities` App users with this permission level are unrestricted, as higher-level access is required to enter the app. Below is a summary of the actions available in the Facilities App:
