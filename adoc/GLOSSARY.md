# Municipio

In Central American countries, "**municipios**" refer to administrative divisions that are similar to municipalities or counties in other parts of the world. Central American countries typically consist of multiple municipios.

Here is how geographic zones are organized in countries that use municipios:

1. **Country:** At the top of the hierarchy is the entire country or republic.
2. **Departments/States:** Below the national level, countries are often divided into larger administrative units known as departments, provinces, or states. These units may vary in name and organization depending on the specific country.
3. **Municipios/Municipalities:** Within each department or province, there are multiple municipios. These are local government units responsible for managing local affairs within their defined boundaries.
