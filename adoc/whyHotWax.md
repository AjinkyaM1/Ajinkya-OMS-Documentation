# Why HotWax Commerce

## Key Omnichannel initiatives
Enable a non-channel restricted use of inventory, ensuring that stock from all their retail locations could be seamlessly utilized for online and in-store sales.
Implement a flexible order fulfillment system that could handle two distinct purchasing patterns, including online orders fulfilled by the store, and same-day buy-online-pick-up-in-store (BOPIS).
Enhance the user experience by offering pickup options within the product display page (PDP).
Utilize "Mixed Cart" to boost the average order value and offer a more diverse range of products to customers.
Reduce shipping time through strategic inventory allocation.

## Prior Initiatives
ADOC had connected one retail location per brand to their eCommerce after the pandemic happened and they were not able to sell from their physical retail space. Pulling inventory from only one retail location meant inventory was limited. The integration between the platforms was not automatic so order processing times were often upwards of 15-20 minutes with the staff being forced to do a lot of manual intervention by store staff.

## Addressing Challenges
HotWax Commerceâ€™s Omnichannel Order Management System provided a comprehensive solution, enabling ADOC to streamline their operations, optimize inventory management, and enhance their order fulfillment process.
